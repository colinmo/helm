# HELM

This is meant to be a main controller for my day-to-day work and other tasks. Currently:

1. Markdown editor for a daily-status
2. Deactivate parental controls on my internet for a set period of time

## Todo

* Add in a `@tag` search capability
* Add in a Markdown preview 
* Add in navigation by calendar dates
* Integration with Planner and JIRA and Cherwell for a combined task view
* [ ] Add a search, integrate with Finder/ Win search?
