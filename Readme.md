# HELM

This is meant to be a main controller for my day-to-day work and other tasks. Currently:

1. Markdown editor for a daily-status
2. Deactivate parental controls on my internet for a set period of time

## Todo

* [ ] Add in a `@tag` search capability
  * [ ] Does basic search count?
* [x] Add in a Markdown preview 
  * [x] Fyne's Markdown preview is crap. Use another?
  * Kinda. Now just using HTML
* [x] Add in navigation by calendar dates
* [x] Add a search, integrate with Finder/ Win search?
  * Couldn't find out how to integrate, so just used `grep` and `findstr`
* [ ] Add a status bar to tasks to show loading/ activity
* [ ] Integration with Planner and JIRA and Cherwell for a combined task view
